Jose B. Corona, 32, pleaded guilty to two felony counts of criminal sexual assault and one misdemeanor count of battery, according to the Kane County state’s attorney’s office. Between August and November 2015, Corona had sexual contact with a student in his East Aurora High School District 131 office, and at his home in the 1300 block of South Glen Court in Aurora, prosecutors said.

Another girl at the school went to DCFS officials in October 2015 saying Corona had made inappropriate advances toward her as well, prosecutors said.

Corona was arrested last November and had been jailed on a $100,000 since. Judge Donald Tegeler on Friday handed down the 12-year sentence, of which Corona must serve at least 85 percent. He will also have to register for life as a sex offender.

“These young women courageously spoke up and confronted Mr. Corona about his acts,” Kane County State’s Attorney Joseph McMahon said in a statement. “Because they did so, they were able to prevent him from victimizing other children. I cannot overstate their bravery in doing the right thing.”
